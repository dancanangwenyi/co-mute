# co-mute

### Please note: You can branch and create a Node.JS, Java or Python implementation if you are not familiar with C#, but Full Stack does use C# as our primary language.

You will be building a web application for a fictional client based on requirements they provided. 

You will need to create an account on GITHUB. The Git repository for the project is named “co-mute” and contains the following folders:
•	spec/ - This folder contains a PDF with the requirements for the web application
•	car-pool-lambda-function/ - This folder contains the source code the backend function that manages the AWS API gateway
•	co-mute/ - The folder conatins all the web application source code


All the implementation has been done according to the user requirements except for the requirement that users cannot join 
pools with overlapping timelines.


The application has also been deployed and hosted on AWS: It can be accessed here: https://dev.dz0b96rspdon3.amplifyapp.com

### Frontend Development
-> The Reactjs ReactJs Framework together with Material UI 


### Backend
	--> The lambda functions are written using JAVA
	--> The AWS API gateway uses the lambda function above to communicate between the client and the AWS DynamoDB
	--> AWS amplify is used to add authentication and hosting to the application
